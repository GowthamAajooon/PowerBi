Step-by-Step Explanation
Load the Datasets:

Purpose: 
First, we need to read the training and testing data from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames. DataFrames are like tables where you can easily manipulate and analyze your data.

Example: train_data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')

_____________________________________
Preprocess the Data:

Purpose: 
We define a function to check for missing values in the dataset. Ensuring the data is clean before analysis is crucial.

Example: 
train_data.isnull().sum()

_____________________________________

Split the Data into Features and Target Labels:

Purpose:
 We separate the dataset into features (X_train) and target labels (y_train). X_train contains all columns except 'Price', while y_train contains only the 'Price' column. This helps in setting up our data for training.

Example: X_train = train_data.drop('Price', axis=1), y_train = train_data['Price']

_____________________________________
Initialize the Models:

Purpose: 
We create a dictionary of different models to test. Each model will be used for predicting the target variable.

Example: models = {'Linear Regression': LinearRegression(), 'Decision Tree': DecisionTreeRegressor()}
:
_____________________________________
Evaluate Each Model

Purpose: We use cross-validation to evaluate each model’s performance based on the R² score, which measures how well the model predicts the target variable.
Example: cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=5, scoring='r2').mean()
Print Model Accuracies:
_____________________________________


Purpose: 
We print the R² scores of each model to compare their performance.

Example: print(f"{model_name}: {score}")

_____________________________________
Identify and Train the Best Model:

Purpose: 
We find the model with the highest R² score and train it on the entire training dataset. We perform cross-validation again to confirm its performance.

Example: best_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

_____________________________________
Predict on the Test Set:

Purpose:
 We use the trained best model to make predictions on the test dataset.

Example: predictions = best_model.predict(X_test)

_____________________________________
Create and Save the Submission File:

Purpose: We create a DataFrame with the test data and the predicted prices and save this DataFrame to a CSV file.

Example: submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)
